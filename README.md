# NLP
In this project, some garden-path sentences have been used to test NLP codes in the space of tokenising and entity recognition.

The below are the steps we took. 
First step: install spacy onto Pycharm.
Second step: load 'en_core_web_sm'. 
Third step: find and save a few garden-path sentences into a list. 
Fourth step: run relevant codes for tokenising and entity recognition.
Fifth step: view results and do analysis.

All the nlp codes we used seem useful and effective.
